# ELE Code of Conduct

The Edinburgh Language Exchange (ELE) is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the ELE organisers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs; deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any ELE event or communication channel. Community members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are **expected to comply immediately**.

If a community member engages in harassing behaviour, the ELE organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, asking the offender to leave the discussion or event, expulsion from the ELE community, and/or removal from an event, without refund in cases of paid-for events.

All ELE community members, organisers, guests and sponsors will be expected to adhere to this code of conduct when engaged with activities and events related to ELE, including in online communications, in-person communication, presentation materials and in any materials and designs brought to an ELE event.

**If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an ELE organiser immediately, or as soon as you feel comfortable doing so.**

The ELE meeting organisers are listed at the Organisers page, and can be contacted individually or severally.

If you have questions or feedback about this Code of Conduct please contact the organisers.

Covid Restrictions Commitment: All ELE members are expected to comply with venues' Covid safety policies, including and not limited to requirements for wearing face coverings, and any entrance checks that might be required by a venue (temperature check, vaccination status, etc). If you have an exemption, please make it known to an organiser or member of staff as soon as possible. If you cannot comply, or do not wish to do so, you are invited to wait to attend events when restrictions have been lifted.
