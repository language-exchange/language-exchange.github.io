In 2019 the event ran on Thursday evenings as a large multi-lingual social gathering at Akva Bar

In 2020 we ran our events online over Discord and webmeetings

In 2021 we ran two weekly multi-lingual socials: Thursday evenings at BrewDog, and Saturday mornings at Black Medecine

In 2022 we encouraged members to organise mini-meetups centered around single languages, and kept the Thursday and Saturday meetups going !
