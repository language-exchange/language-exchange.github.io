# The Edinburgh Language Exchange

The Edinburgh Language Exchange (ELE) aims to promote language learning through social interactions, whether that be a friendly chat in a bar, a walking trip around Edinburgh's many nooks and crannies or simply trying out new experiences (drama workshops, yoga, creative writing classes, etc.)

Because knowing foreign languages is a vital instrument in an ever globalising world, we see the importance of promoting bilingualism as well as providing the opportunities to achieve it.

The group is open to absolutely anyone, whether you're new to the area, just passing through or a true Edinburgher. There are no criteria in terms of level, although we would suggest that members have at least a basic grasp of the language they want to practise.

So, don't be shy, come down and say hello in whatever language you desire. You'll be sure to meet people who are just as excited about sharing their language and culture as learning about yours.
